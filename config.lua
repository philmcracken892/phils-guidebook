        content = 'Crafting is key to survival. Search for resources like wood, stone, and herbs scattered across the map. Use crafting stations in towns or build your own to create tools, weapons, and shelter. Check your inventory for crafting options. Tip: Rare materials are often found in dangerous areas, so prepare before venturing out. Players can discover rare items by thoroughly exploring the map—these valuable finds are hidden in remote locations and reward those brave enough to venture into the unknown.'

        title = 'Surviving the Natives',
        content = 'The local native tribes are territorial and may attack if you encroach on their lands. Avoid conflict by staying out of restricted zones. If confrontation is unavoidable, equip crafted weapons or trade for firearms in towns. Some tribes may trade if approached peacefully—learn their customs to gain their trust. Death means losing some resources, so tread carefully.'

        title = 'Safe Zones and Survival Tips',
        content = 'All major cities serve as safe zones where you can rest, trade, and plan your next move without fear of attack. Hunger and weather are constant threats outside these areas. Hunt animals or gather food to keep your stamina up. Build shelters to rest and store items securely. Form alliances with other players to increase your chances of survival. Remember: venture far from civilization to find the rarest treasures, but always plan your return to safety.'
